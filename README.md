# racing-simulator
a racing simulation utilizing promises and async/await

## Getting Started

In order to play this game, we need to run two things: the game engine API and the front end.

### Start the Server

To run the server, locate your operating system and run the associated command in your terminal at the root of the project.

| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |

Note that this process will use your terminal tab, so you will have to open a new tab and navigate back to the project root to start the front end.

#### WINDOWS USERS -- Setting Environment Variables
If you are using a windows machine:
1. `cd` into the root of the project containing data.json 
2. Run the following command to add the environment variable:
```set DATA_FILE=./data.json```

### Start the Frontend

First, run your preference of `npm install && npm start` or `yarn && yarn start` at the root of this project. Then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000.
